# GameClientDemo

A game demo, also homework of my game client course.

## Branch Statement

For some reasons of net and wrong operations, I created a new project named **Demo** and I pushed it to the branch named **Second**. It is the second homework, and the future homework will be done based on this project instead of master.

## Project Statement

**Second Homework Statement:** Because I am not familiar with Android platform, and I need to test some parts of network, **I packaged the project on Windows**, in the future I will transplant it to Android.

**Third Homework Statement:** Add an **UMG** including **shoot button**, **jump button** and **rank button**.  And user can modify his name in rank interface. (Here is a bug waiting to be fixed that the user can modify all recording name. I will fix it as soon as I can)
