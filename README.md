# GameClientDemo

A game demo, also homework of my game client course.

## Branch Statement

For some reasons of net and wrong operations, I created a new project named **Demo** and I pushed it to the branch named **Second**. It is the second homework, and the future homework will be done based on this project instead of master.

## Project Statement

**Second Homework Statement:** Because I am not familiar with Android platform, and I need to test some parts of network, **I packaged the project on Windows**, in the future I will transplant it to Android.

**Third Homework Statement:** Add an **UMG** including **shoot button**, **jump button** and **rank button**.  And user can modify his name in rank interface. (Here is a bug waiting to be fixed that the user can modify all recording name. I will fix it as soon as I can)

**Fourth Homework Statement:** Add **skeletal animations** to my demo. The features that I achieve are as follow:

- Basic movement animation: Idle, walk, run and jump.
- Aim offset.
- A fire animation(I blend the fire animation with the aim offset)
- A throw animation(like throw grenade)
- free perspective(press 'alt' to enter free perspective and release to quit)

**Fifth Homework Statement:** Physics System:

- Pick up a weapon.
- Shoot different parts of body with different sound.(The sounds of leg and arm are quite weird)
- Grenade weapon and explosion effect.
- Four physics materials: grass, ground, wood and water. 

**Sixth Homework Statement:** Net

- A dedicated server is used.
- Replicated: Gun, shoot effects, death animation, rebirth, kill number, death number, scoreboard, aim offset, montage(like 'throw')
- once competition includes 60s, and the competition is a loop with 5s between each competition.
- ones the game is over, the scoreboard will be shown. It shows name, kill, death and score(kill: +2, death: -1)
